# Prerequisited
There are some points to check and fix if required, before you start your journey in finding out what to do. 

## High chances for success
Let's start from something positive before diving into the limitations and obstacles. You are not the only one who is looking for the question - you can try to google it, and at least this guide is the reliable evidence of the fact you are not the only person that is thinking about it. And the fact of that you are still not found the answer can be contradicted by some common and universal observations:
* Every human child did not have question the "what to do?", and this question arises only for some of humans;
* The sum of the experience of human civilization, expressed in fairy tales and proverbs, tells us: "Water does not flow under a lying stone", "the road is mastered by the one who walks it", and others. 

From the other point of view, there is proverbs like "It's better to go your own way non-optimally, than someone else's way very well"

With the focus on finding answer and some going the way, your chances for success are much more than just thinking, rethinking and over-thinking about it.

## You need energy to move on
To perform and execute, you need energy. At least minimum level of energy is required to start and continue any kind of doing - exploring, thinking, acting, reflecting, searching, etc. If you are totally drained, then recharge a bit before you start.  
If you energy battery counts from 100% to 0%, and you are around 0% now, try to get at least 20% for initial actions. 

### How to understand that you are totaly drained

### How to get the minimal energy 
Movements of your body is the simpliest way to get initial charge. 
* Simple regular walking may be even enough;
* Biking, tracking, running, and similar semi-sport light activities; 
* Sports, dancing, and other.

Another possible way to get the spark for ignition is to look for external idea or challenge, which you can find with blogs, stories, books, movies, music, viewing nature, painting or converstations. It can both set you alive because of wonder or because of your understanding and feeling of someone's misery. But you body movenent is more reliable source of initial energy that any other one. If you move - you will definitely get some charge almost immediately. If you are seeking for something external to iginte you (e.g. idea, story, proposal), it becomes a question of probability, what and when you'll find. 

### Caveats
1. There are some activities that are tied with "obligations" and "duties". Keeping up your room in a specific moment can be energy-positive, i.e. you gain some energy during and after you complete your work, or energy-negative, i.e. you lose your energy because you were under "obligations" pressure of that activity. So:
    * Ask yourself honestly and trust your body answer;
    * Tomorrow could be not the same as today, try and reestimate regularly;
    * Take a note that mindset can influence your energy vector during the doing. 
2. Body movements will not charge you to 100% until it is your "what to do" answer. What it means is that performing IronMan will give you plenty of energy if IronMan is your "What to do" question answer, but will not give you a lot if you just doing it to gain energy.

## Safety environment and supportive surroundings
You should be informed about Maslow's Hierarchy - a series of Human needs aligned in pyramid one by one. The bottom layer is about physical security. It's hard to pay attention to the question "what to do?" if your shelter is insecure, if you experience lack of water and food, if you don't have resources to cover your basic physiological and safety needs. Or at least your question "what to do?" will be focused on satisfaction of theese needs. When your physiological and safety needs are met, the context of the "what to do?" question will be different. Pay some attention on the context of your question "what to do?" and the Maslow's Hierarchy levels your are existing right now.

Another important checkbox is about your surroundings. You can be in single, few or many surroundings around you - parents, close relatives, school, or colledge, or work friends, local community etc. To find the answer for the question: "what to do?", if you didn't find it yet, it might be required to make a step outside of your familiar world around you: things you are fond of, ways you are thinking, mindset, regular habits etc. And the common behaviour of most human communitites is to resist changes and to punish the renegades. There is nothing wrong about it, it's just a evolutionarily proven way to survive. This is visible especially clear in the teenagers community, where it is extremly hard to be not like everyone. Imagine that you want to try to demonstrate your desire to go to the gym and doing homework instead of playing computer games or drinking beer (adapt this example to your experience).
