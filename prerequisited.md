## You need energy to move on
To perform and execute, you need energy. At least minimum level of energy is required to start and continue any kind of doing - exploring, thinking, acting, reflecting, searching, etc. If you are totally drained, then recharge a bit before you start.  
If you energy battery counts from 100% to 0%, and you are around 0% now, try to get at least 20% for initial actions. 

### How to understand that you are totaly drained

### How to get the minimal energy 
Movements of your body is the simpliest way to get initial charge. 
* Simple regular walking may be even enough;
* Biking, tracking, running, and similar semi-sport light activities; 
* Sports, dancing, and other.

Another possible way to get the spark for ignition is to look for external idea or challenge, which you can find with blogs, stories, books, movies, music, viewing nature, painting or converstations. It can both set you alive because of wonder or because of your understanding and feeling of someone's misery. But you body movenent is more reliable source of initial energy that any other one. If you move - you will definitely get some charge almost immediately. If you are seeking for something external to iginte you (e.g. idea, story, proposal), it becomes a question of probability, what and when you'll find. 

### Caveats
1. There are some activities that are tied with "obligations" and "duties". Keeping up your room in a specific moment can be energy-positive, i.e. you gain some energy during and after you complete your work, or energy-negative, i.e. you lose your energy because you were under "obligations" pressure of that activity. So:
    * Ask yourself honestly and trust your body answer;
    * Tomorrow could be not the same as today, try and reestimate regularly;
    * Take a note that mindset can influence your energy vector during the doing. 
2. Body movements will not charge you to 100% until it is your "what to do" answer. What it means is that performing IronMan will give you plenty of energy if IronMan is your "What to do" question answer, but will not give you a lot if you just doing it to gain energy.
