## You need energy to move on
To perform and execute, you need energy. At least minimum level of energy is required to start and continue any kind of doing - exploring, thinking, acting, reflecting, searching, etc. If you are totally drained, then recharge a bit before you start.  
If you energy battery counts from 100% to 0%, and you are around 0% now, try to get at least 20% for initial actions. 

### How to understand that you are totaly drained

### How to get the minimal energy 
Movements of your body is the simpliest way to get initial charge. 
* Simple regular walking may be even enough;
* Biking, tracking, running, and similar semi-sport light activities; 
* Sports, dancing, and other;

### Caveats
There are some activities that are tied with "obligations" and "duties". Keeping up your room in a specific moment can be energy-positive, i.e. you gain some energy during and after you complete your work, or energy-negative, i.e. you lose your energy because you were under "obligations" pressure of that activity. So:
* Ask yourself honestly and trust your body answer;
* Tomorrow could be not the same as today, try and reestimate regularly;
* Take a note that mindset can influence your energy vector during the doing.
