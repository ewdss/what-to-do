# Explore around
Check your surroungind and sources of your desires, beliefes and biases.

## What are the sources of your wishes and desires

For sure you have stories and ideas that inspire you. But how did you get it? Have you read, watched, listened, thought out it? Was it blog, book, audiopodcast, movie, friednly chat? Try to capture the source of top ideas inspired you before. 

Why it can be important to try to clarify it for youself? 
1. First, because if you have some great sources of ideas what to do, that works well before, then you can reuse it again. 
2. Second, if you use only that source as fountain of good ideas, then you could find yourself limited by the qantity, quality, or experience similarity of the ideas you gain from that source. And can try to allow yourself for a few different options. 
3. Third, what is you likely intput channel? Should you search for a new source with the same modality (audio, visual, long-read, shorts, etc)? 
4. Fourth, if you find that some sources provide you low-quality ideas that mostly not work for you, you can lower the priority, or add additional checks, or limit the timeframes for testing this ideas. 

## What are the success criterias of your "perfect outcome"
This step is similar to the "What kind of story insprires you and why" in the [Explore yourself](/explore_yourself.md) chapter. The difference is the connection with the outcome your can imagine (dream) exactly for youself. 
Try to imagine the best possible outcome that satisfies your representation about the right answer for the questions "what to do"?  Let's guess that someone sees his success as VC's partner. But what exectly does this mean? 
* To be involved into the decison making process that can change the world? 
* To have a lot of travels and touches with new startups, founders and stay on the cutting edge of new tech ventures?
* To have a lot of analytics work with the contacts limited only to the group of parters aound? 
* To have an office on the top of fancy building, but again, what for? To invite his/her parents so they can be proud of their child? 
* To have work with sharp people and have a great mutual context? 

This section is definitely not about imaging the pathway to the goal. But what is it about and why is it important? Because you can find some anchors about "positive outcome" that fits exactly for you, and apply it to a nearest, achievable, short-term opportunities. Again, 

If you stuck here again, try again less rationalizing and more feeling. 

## What surroundings do you live in right now? 
Make a simple list of surroungings you live now. Family, job, group of friends, sport club, another club, etc. Briefly assess the history of your being in each of them. Can you gain some support and advance there? Which exact person in each group can be you buddy in your attempts to find the answer for the question "what to do?" In which of them you can get support for searching novella? 

Okay, few thought about this section:
* Remember, that General of War and General of Peace are two different persons that fits well in two different situations: War and Peace accordingly. If the group is not intented to be "the place of growing and promotion", it does not mean that it is bad and you should abandon it immediatly. 
* Generally, if you are open enough and not blind about members of each group, and still did not find the "what to to?" answer, then maybe you'll need additional surroundings for growth. In other case, it can be useful to clean the lens and take a look on the group members once again (be more open-mind, less assessing, etc). Or both. 
* Imagine "best possible course of action" in that group or with this community. Do you feel satisfied? Again, if not, it does not neccessary mean that you have to leave the group, but to look for additional opportunities.
