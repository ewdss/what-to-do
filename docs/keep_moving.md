# Keep moving
Continue piloting both your life and your pursuit of the "what to do?" answer.

The following story is about pilot exams. It’s not fact-checked, so take it as a metaphor. Imagine a commercial aviation pilot during a routine exam being asked:
"You are the captain flying a narrow-body, two-engine commercial airplane, fully loaded with passengers. Right now, you're flying above a long mountain range. Your second pilot felt sick, has been in the lavatory for an hour, and is unable to assist. One engine has failed and stopped. The radio works only inbound — you can hear dispatchers and other planes, but cannot send a distress signal. One of the elderly passengers has lost consciousness and is foaming at the mouth. A woman in late pregnancy, sitting at the back, goes into labor. The senior flight attendant is waiting for your instructions to share with the passengers. What should you do first?"

Correct answer: first of all, you should keep flying the plane.

Lacking a "what to do?" answer should not lead to freezing your life. You still have many daily things that need your attention — personal hygiene, health, relationships with family and friends, work responsibilities, etc. It’s unproductive to neglect these while searching. The fact that you haven’t found your larger direction yet doesn’t mean you shouldn’t maneuver to stay comfortable and safe. Lack of a big course doesn’t mean (and shouldn’t mean) a lack of joy or fun in your day-to-day activities.

## Keep focus, but don't anticipate 
Another great story comes from counter-emergency training for motorcycle drivers. If you're accidentally heading toward a pillar, don’t look at the pillar — look at the open passage nearby. If you keep your focus on the pillar, you’ll end your ride in it. If you keep your focus on the open path, there's a chance you'll make it through.

It’s a good idea to maintain focus on your search — but don’t anticipate the result. What does that mean? It means that if you keep the focus long enough, your mind may start to anticipate the outcomes: creating visions of what the result should be, what the right sources might be, or which ones are impossible. That kind of mental prediction may not help if you're already stuck in overthinking "what to do?"

Imagine you're trying to reach a destination behind a closed door. But the door won’t open. What now?  
Does it open the other way?  
Do you need a lock pick?  
Should you come during working hours?   
Is it the wrong door entirely — maybe just for decoration?  
Will a passerby tell you the event has moved to another building?  
Do you need an appointment?  

While staying focused on getting in, don’t try to anticipate all possible ways of doing it — or you might miss the one real option.

## How to understand if I'm trying and doing the correct things
First of all, trying doesn’t need to be labeled as "correct attempt", because trying is the way you learn what’s correct.

Second — no one knows the answer except you. A few indicators:
* If you're not harming yourself or others, it's probably okay — especially if you enjoy it. Pay extra attention to not harming yourself. That matters.
* If you enjoy it — continue. When searching for the "what to do?" answer, it's not time to optimize. You’re trying to figure out what, not how, how long, can I do it better, should I delegate it, etc.
* Prioritize feeling. Use a long-term emotional tracker. If you gain positive energy 7 times out of 10, you’re likely on the right path.
* A powerful sign: the desire to radiate. If you want to share your experience or energy with others, it might be part of your answer. In contrast, scale is not a reliable sign. Be cautious with scale as a source of motivation.

Likely landmarks of a good path:
* You enjoy the topic and feel curious. You wake up with positive thoughts about it, maybe even a smile.
* Your curiosity expands rather than shrinks. You explore either the depth or the breadth of the topic.
* You feel passionate about mastering the field. Books and vlogs seem to find you on their own.
* You want to radiate — the urge to share it with someone else is a strong signal. 

Signs that it’s not your true path:
* Scale — If it’s the only (or main) motivating factor, evaluate carefully. It can give you lots of work and blunt your deeper desires. It can also lead to chasing status or consumption levels — which usually aren't long-term answers.
* Self-sacrifice — Volunteering and serving others can be great. History knows a lot of examples when self-sacrificing for a benefit of other is intentend to be a strong act, i.e. saving someone life in dangerous conditions. But self-sacrifice in the context of searching for your path might point to guilt, pressure, or emotional exploitation.
* Monetization — While it’s great to eventually make a living from your passion, it’s not essential in the early stages. It’s better to find "what to do?" apart from your work responsibilities than not find it at all. You can figure out integration later.


## Doing smart is better than doing hard
Perseverance is good — but perseverance without assessment just adds entropy. "Doing hard" is a common trap. It keeps you occupied, and an occupied person is less likely to ask uncomfortable questions. One of the rules for instructors in kids' camps (or military drills) is to keep the kids (or recruits) constantly busy. Busy people are more obedient, more tired, and less rebellious.

In your case, your mind might push you to stay busy because that’s easier than feeling lost about "what to do?"

Doing smart doesn't mean being lazy or manipulative. It means regularly checking whether you (or anyone else) actually care about the output — and whether there’s a simpler or better way to get there.

## Find the balance between keep doing and stop doing
Eventually, you may wonder whether you should continue your current effort — especially when you're enjoying it but still need to push yourself to continue. It can be tricky to distinguish between effort to continue and effort to overcome resistance.

You should mostly trust yourself and your feelings — but here are some tips:

Forward direction signs: 
* Expectations are tied to joy and fun. Even if each step takes effort, you feel good after doing it.
* A strong sense of involvement. Even when it’s hard, and you can't not to do it. 

Warning signs: 
* Fear of missing out the opportunity. Unlikely to be a good way to find the "what to do?" answer. Reassure yourself that you can always return to that path later.
* Lack of passion or curiosity, even if you feel responsible or committed. Commitment is great — but not if it locks you into something that distracts you from your real search.

## Failure is an option
Fail fast, fail forward, fail often — this is a mantra in the startup world. Failure is a normal outcome when you’re exploring unknown territory. A failed attempt doesn’t mean you’re wrong or incapable. It just means: “This isn’t the answer I’m looking for. It doesn’t fit me now.” No blame. No need to prove you can "see it through to the end." No pushing just to finish something. Just move on.

## Staying calm and positive
t’s easy to get discouraged when a new attempt fails — or when you feel unsure about your next step. Fortunately, there are many proven ways to handle that: from prayer or meditation to a good evening with friends.

Don’t hesitate to use whatever tools help you stay afloat.
