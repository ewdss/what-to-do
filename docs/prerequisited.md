# Prerequisited
There are some points to check and fix if required, before you start your journey in finding out what to do. 

## Chances for success are raising with your focus and actions
Let's start from something positive before diving into the limitations and obstacles. You are not the only one in the world who is looking for the answer to the question "What to do?". You can try to google it and find topics about it, and at least this guide is the reliable evidence of the fact you are not the only person who is thinking about it. And the fact of that you are still not found the answer can be contradicted by some common and universal observations:
* Every human child born without question the "what to do?", this question arise with growing up and becoming mature, and there are lot of stories about searhing and finding the answer. 
* The sum of the experience of human civilization, expressed in fairy tales and proverbs, tells us: "water does not flow under a lying stone", "the road is mastered by the one who walks it", and others. Actively looking for the answer 

From the other point of view, there is proverbs like "It's better to go your own way non-optimally, than someone else's way very well". So, it's better to look for exactly your answer instead of pulling an owl onto a globe. 

With the focus on finding answer and following the way, your chances for success are much more than just thinking, rethinking and over-thinking about it.

## You need energy to move on
To perform and execute, you need energy. At least minimum level of energy is required to start and continue any kind of doing - exploring, thinking, acting, reflecting, searching, etc. If you are totally drained, then recharge a bit before you start.  
If you energy battery counts from 100% to 0%, and you are around 0% now, try to get at least 20% for initial actions. 

How to get the minimal energy? Movements of your body is the simpliest way to get initial charge. 
* Simple regular walking may be quite enough.
* Gym, biking, trailing, running, dancing and similar light sport-like activities can be good choices.

Another possible way to get the spark for ignition is to look for external idea or challenge, which you can find with blogs, stories, books, movies, music, shorts, viewing nature, painting or converstations. It can both set you alive because of wonder and curiosity or because of your understanding and feeling of someone's misery. But you body movenent is more reliable source of initial energy that any other one. If you move - you will definitely get some charge almost immediately. If you are seeking for something external to iginte you (e.g. idea, story, proposal), it becomes a question of probability, what and when you'll find. 

### Caveats
* There are some activities that are tied with "obligations" and "duties". In a specific moment keeping up your room  can be energy-positive, i.e. you gain some energy during and after you complete your work, or energy-negative, i.e. you lose your energy because you were under "obligations" pressure of that activity. So:
    * Ask yourself honestly and trust your body answer;
    * Tomorrow could be not the same as today, try and reestimate regularly;
    * Take a note that mindset can influence your energy vector during the doing. 
* Body movements will not charge you to 100% until it is your "what to do?" answer. What it means is that performing IronMan will give you plenty of energy if IronMan is your "What to do?" question's answer, but will not give you a lot if you just doing it to gain energy. 
* It's easy to obtain minimal level on energy with physical, but it's also easy to lose it. You can charge yourself during 2-hour gym trainings, and lose everything in 5 minutes with uncontrolled emotions or poor mindset.

## Will to find the solution
Let it be will, wish and desire synonims in that particular case. If energy is torque that moves you, then desire is your power and capacity to apply this torque. You need it both to start your journey and keep going all way long. If you ever read memoirs of prisoners of war imprisoned in concetration camps or memoirs of people stuck in a tough situations (abandoning marine vessels, long-term wearther obstacles in mountains etc), then maybe you have noticed that "experienced" prisoners after some period of living in a terrible conditions in a very confined territories learning to notice if someone in their group is loosing his/her will to live. In such extreme conditions of fighting for the lives they could see the "lost of will to live" with their eyes. Usually such men dies in a couple of days after. 

The will to look for an answer for a question "What to do?" can be very similar. Since the question affects your personality very deeply, and the answer is "unknow where" and "unknown when to resolve", it can be easy to lose you "power" to contine looking for it. You should take care and be very friendly and supportive to your own "will". 

Ensure that you have it in the beginning, and in the next chapters you can find some ideas how to grow and protect it.

## Safety environment and supportive surroundings
You should be informed about Maslow's Hierarchy - a series of Human needs aligned in pyramid one by one. The bottom layer is about physical security. It's hard to pay attention to the question "what to do?" if your shelter is insecure, if you experience lack of water and food, if you don't have resources to cover your basic physiological and safety needs. Or at least your question "what to do?" will be focused on satisfaction of theese needs. When your physiological and safety needs are met, the context of the "what to do?" question will be different. Pay some attention on the context of your question "what to do?" and the Maslow's Hierarchy levels your are existing right now.

Another important checkbox is about your surroundings. You can be in single, few or many surroundings around you - parents, close relatives, school, or colledge, or work friends, sport team, local community, etc. To find the answer for the question: "what to do?", if you didn't find it yet, it might be required to make a step outside of your familiar world around you: things you are fond of, ways you are thinking, mindset, regular habits, etc. 

### Caveats
Common behaviour of most human communitites is to resist changes and to punish the renegades. There is nothing wrong about it, it's just a evolutionarily proven way to survive. This is visible especially clear in the teenagers community, where it is extremly hard to be not like everyone. Imagine that you want to try to demonstrate your desire to go to the gym and doing homework instead of playing computer games or drinking beer (adapt this example to your experience). Suppose to create safe sandbox for your experiments.

## Logging tool will help a lot
Since the journey can take time, and the matter is pretty complex, it's nice to have some logging tool. Your notices and recordings will help you during (and after) your journey to reflect, to get self-support, to remind important details. 
You can use tools you are familiar to. If there is no any, the proven methods are:
* Regular diaries;
* Irregular diares, text sketches; 
* Planning tools, to-do lists, checkboxes;
* Mindmaps;
* (Online) boards, sticking notes;
* Audiorecorded notes.

As far as some parts of the work will be related to the mood and feeling, it can be a good option to start to track emotions via emotional calendar, or mood tracker, or whatever.
