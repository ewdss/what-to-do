There are some points to check and fix if required, before you start your journey in finding out what to do. 

## Chances for success are raising with your focus and actions
Let's start with something positive before diving into the limitations and obstacles. You are not the only one in the world who is looking for the answer to the question "What to do?". You can try to google it and find plenty of topics about it, and at least this guide is reliable evidence that you are not the only person thinking about it. And the fact that you still haven't found the answer can be countered by some common and universal observations:
* Every human child is born without the question "what to do?"—this question arises while growing up and becoming mature. And there are lots of stories about searching for and finding the answer.
* The sum of human civilization’s experience, expressed in fairy tales and proverbs, tells us: "*water does not flow under a lying stone*", "*the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step*", and others. Actively looking for the answer matters.

From another point of view, there are proverbs like "It's better to go your own way non-optimally, than someone else's way very well." So, it's better to look for your answer instead of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole (originally it sounds like pulling an owl onto a globe).

With focus on finding the answer and following the way, your chances of success are much higher than by just thinking, rethinking, and overthinking about it.

## You need energy to move on
To perform and execute, you need energy. At least a minimal level of energy is required to start and continue any kind of activity—exploring, thinking, acting, reflecting, searching, etc. If you are totally drained, recharge a bit before you start.
If your energy battery ranges from 100% to 0%, and you're around 0% now, try to get at least to 20% for initial actions.

How to get minimal energy? Movement of your body is the simplest way to get an initial charge.
* Simple, regular walking may be enough.
* Gym, biking, hiking, running, dancing, and other light sport-like activities can be good choices.

Another possible way to get a spark for ignition is to look for an external idea or challenge, which you can find in blogs, stories, books, movies, music, shorts, nature views, painting, or conversations. It can bring you to life through wonder and curiosity—or through empathy and emotional resonance. But your body movement is a more reliable source of initial energy than anything else. If you move, you will definitely get some charge almost immediately. If you’re seeking something external to ignite you (e.g. an idea, story, or proposal), it becomes a question of probability—what and when you’ll find something that works.

### Caveats
* There are activities tied to "obligations" and "duties". At a specific moment, cleaning your room can be energy-positive (you gain energy during and after doing it) or energy-negative (you lose energy because of the pressure of obligation). So:
    * Ask yourself honestly and trust your body's answer.
    * Tomorrow might not be the same as today—try and reassess regularly.
    * Keep in mind that your mindset can influence your energy vector while doing things.
* Body movement won't charge you to 100% unless it is your "what to do?" answer. For example, doing an IronMan triathlon can give you tons of energy if IronMan is your answer—but it won’t give you much if you're just doing it to feel energized.
* It's easy to reach a minimum energy level with physical movement, but it's also easy to lose it. You can charge yourself during a 2-hour gym session and lose it all in 5 minutes due to uncontrolled emotions or poor mindset.

## Will to find the solution
Let "will", "wish", and "desire" be synonyms in this context. If energy is the torque that moves you, then desire is your power and capacity to apply that torque. You need both to start your journey and to keep going all the way.

If you've ever read memoirs of prisoners of war in concentration camps or of people trapped in extreme situations (abandoned marine vessels, long-term weather obstacles in mountains, etc.), you may have noticed that the more experienced prisoners, after living in such terrible conditions in very confined spaces, could begin to recognize when someone was losing their will to live. In such extreme life-or-death conditions, they could see that loss—and those people usually died within a few days.

The will to find an answer to the question "What to do?" can be very similar. Since the question touches your identity deeply, and the answer is "unknown where" and "unknown when", it's easy to lose your internal power to keep searching. You should take care to be friendly and supportive to your own will.

Make sure you have it at the beginning—and in the next chapters, you’ll find some ideas on how to grow and protect it.

## Safety environment and supportive surroundings
You may be familiar with Maslow's Hierarchy—a series of human needs arranged in a pyramid. The bottom layer is about physical security. It's hard to focus on the question "what to do?" if your shelter is insecure, if you’re lacking food and water, or if you can’t meet your basic physiological and safety needs. Or, at the very least, your "what to do?" question will focus solely on satisfying those needs. Once your physiological and safety needs are met, the context of "what to do?" changes. Pay attention to the context of your question and the Maslow’s level you currently live in.

Another important checkpoint is your surroundings. You likely exist in several circles at once—parents, close relatives, school, college, work friends, sports team, local community, etc. To find the answer to "what to do?", if you haven’t found it yet, you may need to step outside your familiar world—your habits, thought patterns, mindset, etc.

### Caveats
Common behavior in most human communities is to resist change and to punish the renegade. There’s nothing wrong with this—it’s an evolutionarily proven survival strategy. This is especially visible in teenage communities, where it’s extremely hard to be different. Imagine wanting to go to the gym and do homework instead of playing computer games or drinking beer (adjust this example to your experience). You might need to create a safe sandbox for experimentation.

## Logging tool will help a lot
Since the journey may take time and the subject is quite complex, it’s useful to have a logging tool. Your notes and records will help you reflect, get self-support, and recall important details during (and after) the journey.
You can use tools you’re already familiar with. If you don’t have any, proven methods include:
* Regular diaries;
* Irregular diares, text sketches; 
* Planning tools, to-do lists, checkboxes;
* Mindmaps;
* (Online) boards, sticking notes;
* Audiorecorded notes.

As some parts of this work relate to mood and feelings, it might be helpful to start tracking emotions using a mood calendar, mood tracker, or similar tool.
