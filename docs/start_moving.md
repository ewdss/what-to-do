# Start moving

You can't get a new picture while staying in the same place, even if you think about it for centuries. Imagine that you are standing and looking at a hill, or the moon, or a door. You can’t know what’s on the other side of the hill. Maybe if you lived long enough, you could evolve over millions of years and equip yourself with X-ray vision or gravitational sensors — but even then, you wouldn’t have full information about the other side.

Another metaphor for this situation is "Fog of War." While you're standing still, you can only observe the area around you. Somewhere else on the map lies your goal. You can spend a really long time thinking, rethinking, and overthinking, but the path won't appear until you start to move, and the goal won't get any closer until you do.

So, to find the "what to do?" answer — your exact answer that fits you in this specific period of time — you have to start moving. Easy to say, not easy to do, especially when you're still working on the question "What to do?" It’s similar to a challenge from old Slavic fairy tales, where the young hero is told by an antagonist: "Go there, I don’t know where; bring that, I don’t know what." How does the protagonist accomplish this many-unknowns task? By starting to move — and with the help of some miracle friend like [Konyok-Gorbunok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Humpbacked_Horse)

Now let's give it a try. 

## Assess your explorations and prepare a "plan"
The best plan will still be beaten by reality — but planning prepares you for impediments and surprises.

Put together everything you've learned during exploration of yourself and your surroundings: strengths, weaknesses, desires, motivation, inspiration. How do you feel about all of it?
A useful output here is your ability to articulate this to the outer world — to explain your intentions, to check if a new opportunity fits you, or to set personal thresholds before jumping into a trial.
It would be extremely helpful if you feel safe enough to discuss your findings with friends or relatives. You often understand a topic better when you explain it to someone else. And if you're lucky enough to get feedback — even better.

The second part of your "plan" is a list of ideas that will help generate energy. Body movement is the king here, but don't limit yourself to that alone.
A good piece of advice is to grab the low-hanging fruit first. That means — unless you’re already an Olympic-level athlete, you don’t need a top-tier coach. You need a nearby gym with a schedule that works for you. If you can’t travel to Antarctica right now, go to Ayacucho (adapt this example to the nearest city you’ve never visited — and no, it doesn’t have to start with “A”). Don’t get stuck reading reviews or overthinking routes. Don’t scale before you gain speed. Don’t obsess over how to perform better before you’ve even started. In the beginning, the number and breadth of attempts will give you far more value than depth or polish. Just do.

These two sections are enough for the beginning.

## Movement is the King
If you remember the stories that inspire you, most likely they are directly or indirectly related to action. Ten years of meditation in a remote cave is also a form of action. Conscious not-doing — i.e. the decision not to do something — is also a form of action. So acting or doing is an essential part of learning the answer to "what to do?" Again, if thinking hasn’t helped yet, then you need to shift from thinking to trying — and doing is a mandatory companion of trying.

## Become ready for opportunities
"The teacher comes when the student is ready" — says the old proverb. Since the search for the "What to do?" answer can become a mix of rational thinking and irrational sparks, it’s wise to stay open to a little magic. You’ll never know how it will happen — until it does. A person who doesn’t fit your usual idea of a “good advisor” might give you one important insight that changes your direction. A workshop you almost skipped might offer a few nuggets that become the foundation for your next step.

It’s good practice to maintain a positive attitude and open mind while scouting around. Tune your mindset to be ready to accept incoming opportunities — which might arrive in unexpected forms: a random chat in a queue, a roadside billboard, a sudden weekend invitation from a friend.


## Why feeling is important
Frankly speaking, if you haven’t found the "what to do?" answer after all your efforts, it’s unlikely that more pure thinking alone will get you there. Another important point: the phrase "I feel it’s wrong" is never nonsense. Feeling can become a very reliable source of direction during the search phase.


## Be careful with the following of someone's track of doing
Intentions are more important than visible steps in this case. Be very careful about following someone else's path — especially if you don’t know the guide personally. If you do know them, at least you can guess their intentions and cross-check them against your own mindset and values. But when you’re learning from a written (or vlogged) success or failure story, you can’t conduct that same cross-check.

A quick example: imagine you’re inspired by the story of someone building a charity school in a remote corner of the world.
* One reader might be inspired by the desire to help underprivileged children.
* Another might be inspired by learning construction skills and working with limited resources.
* Another still might love the idea of traveling and working in remote areas.

So, while the story may be inspiring, be cautious about directly following the visible path rather than understanding the intention behind it.

## Some discipline would be needed
Fortunately — or unfortunately — you’ll need at least a bit of discipline to keep moving in the very beginning. A lot of things will try to anchor you to your home port.
* Alcohol and drugs. Not sure if “disciplined consumption of alcohol” is a valid term — but still.
* Disciplined eating. Junk food or random (unscheduled) eating can greatly reduce your energy.
* Disciplined schedule. Pay attention to at least two parts of your schedule: sleep and energy-recharge slots (via body movement or whatever else you're experimenting with)

A few things to remember:
1. Searching for the answer to "What to do?" can be a very energy-intensive process. And the Universe (God, the world, or whatever you believe in) usually sends opportunities to those who have enough positive energy to handle and embrace them. Coming back to reality: your companions will likely offer opportunities or ideas to the person who has the most energy around them.
2. It’s hard to radically change habits or routines overnight — the chances of success are low. Don’t try to change everything at once. Add just enough discipline to push beyond your current comfort zone — but not so much that you instantly reject it.
3. You’ll need to start your own battle to grow and protect your positive energy. Try to keep energy drainers out of your energy bank — anything from toxic relationships to binge-watching endless TV shows.

## After all of above, if some exact ideas is needed
It’s totally understandable if that very first step still feels hard. Probably chatting with an LLM about this topic will be helpful — and you’ll get a list of ideas to try, ranging from cooking new dishes to sensory deprivation pods.

A few considerations:
* Don’t fixate on monetization at the very beginning. Volunteering, learning, working out, hiking — these can all be quick and useful starting points. Focus on trying, moving, and getting experience. Clarify value later.
* Think in terms of easy-to-start, short-term options. For example: if your dream is to join an offshore sailing race but you’ve never set foot on a boat, maybe it’s best to start with a beginner course at a local yacht school, volunteer at a sailing event, or join a one-day charter trip. These steps will give you far more clarity, energy, and networking than endlessly thinking about a distant goal.
* Prefer in-person and group activities over online and solo — if possible. A few mates around you will speed up comprehension.
