# Inspect the results
At a certain point in time you'll understand (or feel) that it's time to look around and decide what to do next. You can proceed to the inspection part upon your feeling it's the right time to do it. It can be days, week, months until you are ready to inpsect and adapt. All possibilites are fine. 

## Write a memo about the accomplished stage
Invest some time into describing your experience, feeling, insight, results, and everything else you observed during the iteration. Ask LLM if you need structured topics or questions to work with. If totally stuck, use simple retrospective techniques and games to complete it by yourself: 
* What was good and promoting, what was not good and interrupting, ideas and isights for the next iteration, action plan.
* Sailboat retrospective game
* Orbit retrospective game 
...

## Talk about your pursuit with someone
Talking is a good (probably, the best) method to determine the results and integrate it into yourself. Such converstation can also deepen the relationship with your companion, can bring some insights via feedback or similar story from the opposite side. 

## It can be long journey with a simple answer at the finish
The question "what to do" is tied with all your personality which is and was exposed to a lot of thing, starting from genes and your parents relationship until you was born and ending with the ad billboard your have seen but didn't pay attention yesterday. Noone knows if you find the correct answer for you at the next corner or at the next decade. So on the one side you should not anticipate the duration of journey and on the other side have some joy of the journey itself, which will be covered later. 

Another important thing to mention that the answer can be very simple. When you find it, you could cry out: "how is that possible, it was always right here nearby". But the process of adoption, understanding, and implementation of the answer can be long enough. Or not. Respect the asnwer and don't downplay the results, even if it turns out to be simple enough. You journey is worthy of reverence.
