# Inspect the results
At a certain point, you'll understand (or feel) that it’s time to look around and decide what to do next. You can move to the inspection stage when you feel it’s the right moment. That might be days, weeks, or months from now — all timelines are fine.

## Write a memo about the accomplished stage
Invest some time in describing your experiences, feelings, insights, results, and everything else you observed during this iteration. Ask an LLM if you need structured prompts or questions to help you organize your thoughts. If you're totally stuck, use simple retrospective techniques and games to complete it on your own:
* What was good and helpful, what was not good and interrupting, ideas and insights for the next iteration, action plan
* Sailboat retrospective game
* Orbit retrospective game 
...

## Talk about your pursuit with someone
Talking is a good (probably the best) method to clarify your results and integrate them into your self-awareness. Such conversations can also deepen your relationship with your companion and may offer insights through feedback or similar stories from their side.

## It can be long journey with a simple answer at the finish
The question "what to do?" is tied to your entire personality — which has been shaped by everything from your genes and your parents’ relationship before you were born, to the ad billboard you saw yesterday but didn’t notice. No one knows whether you’ll find the right answer for you at the next corner or in the next decade. So, on one hand, don’t try to anticipate the duration of the journey. On the other, try to enjoy the journey itself — a topic we’ll cover later.

Another important thing: the answer may turn out to be very simple. When you find it, you might cry out, “How is that possible? It was right here all along!” But the process of adoption, understanding, and implementation of that answer can be long. Or not.

Respect the answer. Don’t downplay the result — even if it turns out to be surprisingly simple.
Your journey is worthy of reverence.
