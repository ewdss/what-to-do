# Explore youself
Before you start the initial, and later each next iteration of searching for the answer to the question "What to do?", it could be useful to know or remember some helpful things about yourself that can help you calibrate your compass.

## What kind/type of person you are
The simplest personality definition is introversion and extraversion. And you probably know who you are in that context. Even that kind of knowledge can be helpful, because introversion-like persons are energized by solitude and use energy to interact with people, while extraversion-like persons live in the opposite energy flow.

There are also many other methods and personality type models you can explore: MBTI, DISC, CliftonStrengths, etc.

Why can knowing your personality be helpful? For a few reasons:
1. It can give you support by realizing you're not the only "strange one" with this personality type. If authors write books about it, then at least some people of this type exist — and have probably survived just fine.
2. It can focus your attention on your strengths, since each type has strengths alongside weaknesses.
3. It can help you focus on opportunities that complement your type and pay less attention to options that are less likely to suit you.
4. Sometimes you feel important things about yourself but can’t clearly express them due to shyness, lack of self-awareness, or limited experience. Taking some tests and studying the results can help you articulate your strengths, needs, and expectations more clearly — making it easier for others to understand and support you.
5. If you scroll a few pages back and forward in the personality type descriptions, you might find insights about other character types that either attract or repel you — and reflect a bit on why that is.

## What kind of story insprires you and why
For sure, you have a list of stories that inspire and motivate you. Maybe you read them somewhere, heard them, or watched them. Let's assume one of them is the story about the creation of the Suez Canal. Does it mean that you should now look for an ongoing terraforming project and try to join it? Maybe yes, but probably not. Instead, try asking yourself: why are you inspired?

In that particular example, a wide range of different elements could inspire you:
* How the idea was initially discovered
* Multi-national collaboration and diplomatic efforts
* Well-done planning and the alignment between plan and outcome
* Poor planning and how they handled challenges during construction
* Beauty of the technical solution, engineering difficulties, and the cutting-edge tools used to build the Canal
* New job opportunities for local tribes
* Unfair exploitation of uneducated and vulnerable local populations
* The ripple effects on world trade and maritime logistics
* Changes in shipbuilding and navigation triggered by the Canal
* Iconic images of sailing vessels in the desert
* ...

Take your time and go through your list of inspirational sources. You might find many recurring themes that make sense to you.

Of course, the list shouldn’t be limited to stories alone. It can include movies, cartoons, fairy tales, photos, paintings, short films, music, events, etc.

### Caveats
Asking yourself "why" can be hard work. Don’t blame yourself if you can’t instantly find an answer.
If you're stuck, it can help to reduce the level of thinking and rationalizing and increase feeling — which "why" explanation makes you feel most involved, energized, or happy?

## Checks in extreme conditions 
While most theories work well in normal conditions, they should always be tested in extreme (boundary) conditions. In various self-development courses and books, you can find techniques that ask you to imagine yourself in a fictional situation and reflect on your thoughts.

The simplest approach is to ask yourself questions like:
* What would I do if I had a lot of money in my bank account (or in my pocket)?
* What would I do if I knew for sure that I only had N months left to live?
* What would I do if I found myself on a deserted island? (safe, no predators, plenty of food, with shelter, etc.)
* What would I do if I knew for sure that the next project I start would be totally successful?

Ask an LLM to generate a few more questions adapted to your circumstances and context.

If you're reading this guide and don’t yet have a satisfactory answer to the question "What to do?", then you probably also won’t have clear answers to these extreme-condition questions — and that’s totally okay!

Here are a few tricks you can use to move forward:
* Reduce rationalizing and increase feeling. For example: "If I really had a lot of money in my bank account, I would feel excited and energized by doing..."
* Reduce the scale and uncertainty by adding a shorter timeframe. For example: "If I had a lot of money in my bank account, during the next few hours/days/weeks I would..."

It doesn’t hurt to add a few "why" questions to identify the core of your excitement.
