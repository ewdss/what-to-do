# Explore around
Check your surroundings and sources of your desires, beliefs, and biases.

## What are the sources of your wishes and desires

For sure you have stories and ideas that inspire you. But how did you get them? Did you read, watch, listen, or think them up? Was it a blog, book, audio podcast, movie, or friendly chat? Try to capture the sources of the top ideas that have inspired you before.

Why is it important to try and clarify this for yourself?
1. First, because if you have some great sources of what to do ideas that worked well before, you can reuse them.
2. Second, if you only use that one source as your fountain of good ideas, then you might end up limited by the quantity, quality, or similarity of the ideas you get. You could try allowing yourself a few new options.
3. Third, what is your likely input channel? Should you search for a new source with the same modality (audio, visual, long-read, short-form, etc)?
4. Fourth, if you notice that some sources provide mostly low-quality ideas that don’t work for you, you can lower their priority, add extra checks, or limit the time spent testing ideas from those sources.

## What are the success criterias of your "perfect outcome"
This step is similar to the "What kind of story inspires you and why" section in the [Explore yourself chapter](/explore_yourself.md). The difference here is the connection with the outcome you can imagine (or dream of) specifically for yourself.

Try to imagine the best possible outcome that would satisfy your idea of the right answer to the question "what to do?" Let’s say someone sees success as becoming a VC partner. But what exactly does that mean?
* To be involved in decision-making that can change the world?
* To travel a lot and connect with new startups and founders, staying at the cutting edge of tech?
* To focus on analytics work, with contact limited only to a few close partners?
* To have an office on the top floor of a fancy building — and if so, why? To invite parents and make them proud?
* To work with sharp, inspiring people and share great mutual context?

This section is definitely not about imagining a pathway to the goal. It is about identifying a few anchor points of a positive outcome that feels right for you, and then applying them to your nearest, achievable, short-term opportunities.

If you're stuck here again, try less rationalizing and more feeling.

## Assess if you can you rely on your surroudings
Make a simple list of the surroundings you live in now: family, job, group of friends, sports club, hobby group, etc. Briefly reflect on your history in each of them. Can you gain some support or growth there? Who exactly in each group could be your buddy in your attempts to answer the question "what to do?" In which groups can you get support for your personal quest or experiments?

A few thoughts on this section:
* Remember that the Chief of War and Chief of Peace are two different roles that fit different moments — War and Peace, accordingly. If a group wasn’t designed to be a place of growth and promotion, it doesn’t mean it’s bad or that you need to leave it immediately.
* Generally, if you're open enough and not blind to the potential of people around you — and still haven’t found your "what to do?" answer — then maybe you’ll need some additional surroundings for growth. Or maybe it’s time to clean the lens and look at those group members again (with more openness and less judgment). Or do both.
* Imagine the best possible course of action in that group or community. Do you feel satisfied by that vision? If not, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should leave — but maybe you should look for complementary opportunities elsewhere.
