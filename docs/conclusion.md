* Not knowing what to do (in strategic, life-orientation direction) is normal. Although a lot of people don't experience it, either having build-in direction to their North star, either living successful lives without paying attention to the "what to do?" question, it's absolutely Okay for you being asking this question and looking for a convenient asnwer.
* Looking for the answer to "What to do?" question is extremly energy consuming and tough course of actions. Obscurity consume a lot. But in the end you'll be fine!
* Pay some attention to assess your own thoughts, wishes, desires and inspirations. Ask chains of "why" question to get to the roots. It will reduce the chances of loitering and bouncing, and can help to set a general course for searching. 
* Provide the energy to yourself. Protect your energy and will from draining by meaningless and destructive things.
* Movement is the King. You can't reveal Fog of War and traveling the path staying still. When thinking is not working any more, start moving, trying, testing. Don't stick to perfection, optimization and performance. Clumsy steps forward will give you much more than pondering the best possible way to lift you leg. 
* Decrease rationalization and (over)thinking, increase feeling. If you did not get to the desired point, that continue thinking only is not the best vehicle to get there. Feeling will strongly complement your internal compass, at least on the stage of looking for a right direction and far ahead to the mastering the found and approved opportunity. 
* Keep focus while seaching, but don't anticipate the right answer. It can get from the opposite direction, and you should be open and ready to accept that, and anticipation is making your "expectation angle" very narrow. 
* Failure is an option. Trying is the process of finding right and wrong via success and failure respectively. 
* Walking your own way slowly and staggering is better than riding other's way fast and easy but in the wrong direction. 
* You'll probably find simple or unexpected answer but the process of finding, accepting, and adoption could be long, don't belittle it.
