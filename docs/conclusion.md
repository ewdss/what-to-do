# Counclusion

* Not knowing what to do (in a strategic, life-orientation sense) is normal. Although many people don’t experience it — either because they have a built-in direction toward their North Star, or because they live successful lives without paying attention to the "what to do?" question — it’s absolutely okay for you to be asking this question and looking for a meaningful answer.
* Looking for the answer to the "What to do?" question is extremely energy-consuming and a tough course of action. Obscurity drains a lot. But in the end — you’ll be fine!
* Pay some attention to your own thoughts, wishes, desires, and inspirations. Ask chains of "why?" questions to get to the roots. This will reduce the chances of loitering or bouncing around, and it can help you set a general direction for your search.
* Provide energy to yourself. Protect your energy and will from being drained by meaningless or destructive things.
* Movement is the King. You can’t reveal the Fog of War or travel the path while staying still. When thinking stops working, start moving, trying, testing. Don’t get stuck on perfection, optimization, or performance. Clumsy steps forward will give you far more than endless pondering about the best possible way to lift your leg.
* Decrease rationalization and (over)thinking; increase feeling. If you haven’t reached the desired point, continuing to think alone is probably not the vehicle that will get you there. Feeling can strongly complement your internal compass — especially during the search phase, and long before you reach mastery in a chosen direction.
* Keep focus while searching, but don’t anticipate the correct answer. It might arrive from an unexpected direction, and you should be open and ready to accept that. Anticipation narrows your “expectation angle.”
* Failure is an option. Trying is the process of discovering right and wrong — through success and failure respectively.
* Walking your own path — slowly and unsteadily — is better than riding someone else’s fast and easy, but in the wrong direction.
* You’ll probably find a simple or unexpected answer, but the process of discovering, accepting, and adopting it can take time. Don’t belittle the journey.
