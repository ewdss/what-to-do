You can't get new picture while staying on the same place even if you think about it for centuries. Imagine, that you are staying and looking on the hill, or moon, or door. You can't know what is on the other side of the hill. Maybe if you could live long enough, you can spend millions of years of evolution to equip youself with X-Ray eyes or gravitation sensors, but even after that you would not have full information of the situation on the other side. 

Another metahpor for this situation is "Fog of War". While you are standing still, you can observe only area around you. Somewhere on the other part of the map is you goal. You can spend really long time thinking, rethinking, and overthinking, but the path will not appear until you start to move, and the goal will not become closer until you move. 

So, to find the "what to do?" answer, exactly your answer that fits you in that certain period of time, you have to start moving. Easy to tell, not easy to accomplish if you working on the question "What to do?" Similar to the task from old slavic fairy tales, where young hero is asked by his antagonist: "Go there, I don't know where, bring that, I don't know what". How does protagonist accomplish this "many unknowns" task? By starting moving and with the help of some miracle friend like [Konyok-Gorbunok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Humpbacked_Horse)

Now let's give it a try. 

## Assess your exploration and prepare a "plan"
The best plan will be beaten by reality, but planning prepares you for impediments and suprises. 

Put all toghether you have found during explorartion of yourself and surroundings: strenghs, weaknesses, desires, motivation, inspiration topics. How do you feel about that all? 
The effective output of that is you ability to articulate it to the outer world when you need to explain your intentions, or have check-list to check if yet another opportunity around match you, or setup thresholds before jumping into the trial. 
It would be extremely helpful if you feel safe to discuss your findings with your friends or relatives. Often you understand the topic better if you tell it to somebody. And even better, if you are lucky one to get some feedback. 

Second section of your "plan" is the list of ideas that will saturate you with the energy. Body movement is the king here, but should not be limited to that approach only. 
A good advice here is to get the low hanging fruit. What it means is that until you are not the Olympic-level athlete, you don't need top-of-the-notch coach. You need the closest gym with the suitable schedule. If you can't travel to the Antarktida right now, travel to the Ayacucho (adapt this example to the nearest city you have never been to, and it should not start on A, of course). So, don't stuck in reading review or thinking throght the route. Don't scale before you get the speed. Don't center on how to perform better. Simply do.  

This two sections are enough for the beginning. 

## Become ready for opportunities
"The teacher comes when the student is ready" - old proverb says. Since the process of searching for the "What to do?" answer can become mix of rationalized approaches and irrationalized sparks, its nice to become ready for some kind of magic to happened. 


## Why feeling is important
Frankly speaking, if you was not able to find "what to do?" answer for a long time with all your efforts you have put into thinking about that, then it's not common that you can find the answer only with your brain power. Another very important point is that phrase "you feel it wrong" in a nonsense. Feeling can become reliable source of direction for searching period. You can feel differently if you

## Some discipline would be needed
Fortunately or unfortunaly, you'll need at least little of discipline to keep the motion at the very beginning. There are a lot of thing that will anchoring you to your home port. 
* Alcohol and drugs. Not sure if "disciplined consumption of alcohol" makes sense, but whatever. 
* Disciplined schedule 
* Disciplined eating. Trash food or unscheduled food will reduce your energy greatly. 
* Disciplined schedule. You should point your attention to at least two parts of your schedule: sleeping and timeslots your distingushed for gaining the energy (via body movement or anything else you are trying).

Couple of things:
1. Searching for the answer for the question "What to do?" can become very energy-intensive process. And Universe (God, world, anything else you belive) usually send opportunities to persons with positive energy reserve to handle and exploit it. Descending to the ground, your companions will offer something or highlight insites to a more energetic person around them. 
2. It can be very hard to changle your habbits and schedule radically. Low chances of success here. Don't try to change all in once in a great scale. Add some discipline, beyound your present level of comfort, but below the level of rejection. 
3. So, you should start your own fight for growing and keeping the positive enery.
