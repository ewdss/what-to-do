You can't get new image staying on the same place. Imagine, that you are looking on the hill, or moon, or door. You can't know what is on the other side of the hill. Maybe if you could live long enough, you can spend millions of years of evolution to equip youself with X-Ray eyes or gravitation sensors, but even after that you would not have full information of the situation on the other side. 

Another metahpor for this situation is "Fog of War". While you are standing still, you can observe only thinks around you. Somewhere on the other part of the map is you goal. You can spend really long time thinking, rethinking, and overthinking, but: the path will not appear until you start to move, and the goal will not become closer until you move. 

So, to find the "what to do?" answer, exactly your answer that fits you in that certain period of time, you have to start moving. Easy to tell, not easy to accomplish if you working on the question "What to do?" Similar to the task from old slavian fairy tales: "Go there, I don't know where, bring that, I don't know what".

But let's give it a try. 

## Assess your exploration and prepare a "plan"
The best plan will be beaten by reality, but planning prepares you for impediments and suprises. 


## Become ready for opportunities
"The teacher comes when the student is ready" - old proverb says. Since the process of searching for the "What to do?" answer can become mix of rationalized approaches and irrationalized sparks, its nice to become ready for some kind of magic to happened.
