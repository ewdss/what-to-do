## It can be long journey with a simple answer at the finish
The question "what to do" is tied with all your personality which is and was exposed to a lot of thing, starting from genes and your parents relationship until you was born and ending with the ad billboard your have seen but didn't pay attention yesterday. Noone knows if you find the correct answer for you at the next corner or at the next decade. So on the one side you should not anticipate the duration of journey and on the other side have some joy of the journey itself, which will be covered later. 

Another important thing to mention that the answer can be very simple. When you find it, you could cry out: "how is that possible, it was always right here nearby". But the process of adoption, understanding, and implementation of the answer can be long enough. Or not. Respect the asnwer and don't downplay the results, even if it turns out to be simple enough. You journey is worthy of reverence.
