# What to do if you don't know what to do
Yet another guide to try to find it out what to do.  

Imagine that today you woke up energized and with a strong anticipation of a wonderful day ahead. It's a great feeling that gives you a lot of confidence and support to live today. Unfortunately, not every day is the day like that. Instead of anticipation of a good day ahead sometimes (or quite often) it is possible to wake up with the question: "What could I do today?" Definitely not everyone is trapped with this question: some people live pretty successful and joyful life without asking this question, some people have "build-in" compass that guides them to their goals. N.B. But don't plant the seed of envy, since you don't know the questions they face.

But if you face questions like "what to do", "what is my purpose", "what value can I deliver", and similar, maybe this guide can be yet another tool to support you in the research of this vital questions. 

To clarify the possible value of this guide: 
1. It may be interesting if you are looking for long-term prospects of your life and you don't even know what it can be about, even in form of dreams and wishes.  
2. It may provide you some support if you know your strategic goal or dream, but it is so far-far away (or complex, or extra-large scale), that you don't have a pathway how to reach it. 
3. It is not intented to find the way of doing something you know about, and you basicly know how to do it, but you don't have experience. For example, if you need to repair the water tap, but don't know anything about plumbing, this guide is not the right tool to answer the question: "I don't know what to do." 

Few words about the foundation of this guide:
1. It uses well-known repetitive cycles of action with the feedback loops like PDCA, HADI, Agile iteraction cycle, Cisco PPDIOO, etc. 
2. It is based on the related to the title reccurring ideas from set of the books, articles and movies compiled together. 

The structure of the guide:
1. Chapters 
2. Topics  
    2.1. Description  
    2.2. Caveats [Optional]  
    2.3. Links to external resources [Optional]
