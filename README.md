# What to do if you don't know what to do

Yet another guide to try to find out what to do.

Imagine that you woke up today energized and with a strong anticipation of a wonderful day ahead. It's a great feeling that gives you a lot of confidence and support to live today. Unfortunately, not every day is a day like that. Instead of anticipation of a good day ahead, sometimes (or quite often) we wake up with the question: "What could I do today?" Not everyone is trapped by this question, definitely: some people live pretty successful and joyful lives without asking this question, and some people have a "built-in" compass that guides them. But don't plant the seed of envy, since you don't know the questions they face.

But if you face questions like "what to do", "what is my purpose", "what value can I deliver", and similar, maybe this guide can be yet another tool to support you in the research of these vital questions.

To clarify the possible value of this guide:

1. It may be interesting if you are looking for long-term prospects in your life and you don't know what it could be about, even in the form of dreams and wishes.
2. It may provide you some support if you know your strategic goal or have a dream, but it is so far-far away (or complex, or extra-large scale) that you don't have a pathway to reach it.
3. It is not intended to find the way of doing something you know about, and you basically know how to do it, but you don't have experience. For example, if you need to repair the water tap but don't know anything about plumbing, this guide is not the right tool to answer the question: "I don't know what to do."

Few words about the foundation of this guide:

It uses well-known repetitive cycles of action with feedback loops like PDCA, HADI, Agile iteration cycle, Cisco PPDIOO, etc.

It is based on the recurring ideas related to the title from a set of courses, books, articles, etc., compiled together.
