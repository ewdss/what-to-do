# Keep moving

One story is about pilot exams. It is not fact-checked, so take is as metaphor. Imagine, that commercial aviation pilot during regular exam get the question to answer: "You are captain flying narrow-body 2-engine commercial airplane, fully loaded with passangers. Right now you are above long mountain range. You second pilot felt seek, staying in the lavatory for 1 hour and unable to help you piloting the plane. One engine has just failed and stopped. Radio is working only inbound and you can't send distress signal, but can hear all comms from dispatchers and other planes. One of the elderly passengers lost consciousness and was foaming at the mouth. A woman at the end of the salon in late pregnancy goes into labor. Senior flight attendant is waiting for directions to transmit it to other passengers. What should you do first?"
Correct answer: first of all, you should keep flying the plane. 

Another nice story is from counter-emergency training for motorcycle drivers. If you accidentaly driving into the pillar, don't look at the pillar, but look to the passage nearby. If you look at the pillar, you'll definitely end you current riding in the pillar. If you look and keep you focus at the passage, there are chances that you pass there. 


## Keep focus, but don't anticipate 


## How to understand if I'm trying and doing the correct things
First of all, "trying" does not match the adjective "correct", because trying is the process of understanding the correctness. 

Secondly, no one knows except youself. Few pegs:
* If you do not harm yourself or other living beings, then it is probably okay to do. Especially if you enjoy it. Pay special attention to not harming yourself. This is important.
* If you enjoy, continue doing. When looking for the "What to do?" answer, it's not the best time to optimize things. Just try to figure out what to do. Not "how?", "how long?", "can I do it better?", "can I delegate it?", etc. 
* Use feeling first. Use long-term emotional calendar, etc. If you gain positive energy 7 times of 10, then you are probably on the right track. 
* The very strong indicator that you want to radiate around. If you want to share and radiate, then it can be a good lead to the list of answers of the "what to do?" question. In the opposite, scale is not. Be cautious with scale as a source of energy. 

What is likely to be the landmarks of a good path:
* You enjoy the topic and are curious about it. You wake up with a positive thoughts about it, you smile when you thing about it. 
* Your curiosity expands, but not shrink. You study either depth either width of the topic.
* You want to radiate about the topic. Desire to share with someone is extremly strong proof of the right direction. 

What is not likely to be the signs of the your path:
* Scale. If scale is complemented to something else, it's fine. If scale is the only (or main) sign around your direction, then assess it carefully. Couple of possible false-captivating points about the scale are: 
    * Scale can feed you with a lot of work, so your desire for looking the "what to do?" answer could be blunted. 
    * Scale can guide you to the status or higher consumption level, which are very not likely to be the long-term answer of the "what to do?" question. 
* Self-sacrifice. Serving and different types of volunteering is a good options to go. And the history knows a lot of examples when self-sacrificing for a benefit of other is intentend to be a strong act, i.e. saving someone life in dangerous conditions. But in the context of the searching for "what to do?" answer self-sacrifice can be sign of an abusive relationship or explotation of guilt. Check twice.
* Monetization. Adult person spends most of his active time on the work place. It is extremly important if you can combine both your joy and your job. But don't care about it much at the very beginning. It's much better to find "what to do?" answer aside of your professional duties than not find it at all. You can manage it later for sure when you'll be firm about you direction. So, if you
