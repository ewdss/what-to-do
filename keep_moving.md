## How to understand if I'm trying and doing the correct things
First of all, "trying" does not match the adjective "correct", because trying is the process of understanding the correctness. 

Secondly, no one knows except youself. Few pegs:
* If you do not harm yourself or other living beings, then it is probably okay to do. Especially if you enjoy it. Pay special attention to not harming yourself. This is important.
* If you enjoy, continue doing. When looking for the "What to do?" answer, it's not the best time to optimize things. Just try to figure out what to do. Not "how?", "how long?", "can I do it better?", "can I delegate it?", etc. 
* Use feeling first. Use long-term emotional calendar, etc. If you gain positive energy 7 times of 10, then you are probably on the right track. 
* The very strong indicator that you want to radiate around. If you want to share and radiate, then it can be a good lead to the list of answers of the "what to do?" question. In the opposite, scale is not. Be cautious with scale as a source of energy.
