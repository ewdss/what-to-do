# Explore youself
Before you start the initial and later each next iteraction of the searching the answer to the question "What to do?", it could be useful to know out or remember some useful things about yourself, that can help you to calibrate your compass. 

## What kind/type of person you are
The simplest definition is introversion and extraversion. And you probably know who you are in that context. And even that kind of knowledge can be helpful because introversion-like persons are getting energized buy loneliness and use energy to interact with people, and extraversion-like person live in the opposite currents of energy. 
And there are a lot of other methods and defined types, which you can try: MBTA, DISC, Cliffton Strength, etc. 

Why knowing your personality can be helpful? Because of few reasons:
1. It can give you support by knowing that you are not the only "strange one" with this type of personality. If authors of the book describe it, then at least some of such type of person exist and probably survive somehow. 
2. It can focus your attention on your strenghs since each kind and type has strenght in addition to the weaknesses. 
3. It can help you to focus on opportunities that is complimentary to your type and pay less attention to the options that are less likely to fit you. 
4. Sometimes you feel important things about yourself but can't express in clearly due to lack of experience or shyness. Conducting some test and studing the results can help you to articulate your strenghs, needs and expectations more clearly so other people can better understand your requests.
5. If you scroll few pages back and forward in the personality types descriptions, you can find some insights about characters that attract or push you off and reflect a bit about that.

## What kind of story insprires you and why
For sure you have the list of stories that inspires and motivates you. Maybe you read it somewhen, heard or whatever. Let's assume that one of its is the story about creation of the Suez Canal. Does it mean that you should look for an ongoing terraforming project and try to join? Maybe yes, but probably not. Instead of it, try to ask yourself, why are you inspired. In that particular example there can be a vast point in the list of possibilities that inspire you:
* How this idea was found? 
* Multi-national collaboration and diplomacy
* Well-done planning and the correlation of the result with the intended plan
* Poor-done planning and handling the challenges arising during construction
* Technical challenges and cutting-edge tools used to build the Canal
* New working places and opportunities for local tribes
* Unfair explotation of the uneducated and vulnerable parts of the local population
* Subsequent shifts in the world trading and maritime logistics
* Changes in shipbuilding and navigation caused by navigation through the Canal
* Inspiring pictures of the sailing vessels in the desert
* ...

Take your time and go throught your list of inspiration sources. Maybe you'll find a lot of similaritites that make sense just for you. 

Of course, the list should not be only limited by stories by themselves. It can be movies, cartoons, fairy tales, and even photos or paintings. 

### Caveats
Asking youself "why" could become a pretty hard job. Don't blame yourself if you can't instantly get the answer from yourself.   
If you are stuck, it can be useful to decrease the level of "thinking and rationalizing" and increase feeling - which explanation of "why" make you feel involved, energized of happy.

## Extreme conditions 
While most of the theories work well in normal conditions, its should alway be tested in extreme (boundary) conditions. In the various self-development courses and books you can find similar techniques that asks you to put yourself in a some fictious case and environemnt and reflect on your thoughts.
The simplest is the asking yourself questions like this:
* What will I do if I have a lot of money on my bank account (in my pocket)?
* What will I do if I know for sure that I have only N months to live? 
* What will I do if I find myself on the lonely island? (safe, without predators, with plenty of food, with safe shelter, etc)
* What will I do if I know for sure that next project (business) that I will start will be totaly successful? 

Ask LLM to generate few questions adapted to your curcumstances and relevant for you.

If you are reading this guide and don't have satisfactory asnwer for the question: "What to do", then probalby you would not have clear answers for the questions testing you in the extreme conditions. It's totally okay! There are few tricks you can use to go ahead:
* Reduce rationalizing and increase feeling. I.e. "If I have a really lot of money on my bank account, I'll feel very excited and energized by doing ... ".
* Reduce the scale and uncertainty by adding small timeframes. I.e. "If I have a really lot of money on my bank account, the next few hours I will ... ".

It would not hurt to add few "why" quesstions to pick out the core of your excitement.
