Before you start the initial and later each next iteraction of the searching the answer to the question "What to do?", it could be useful to know out or remember some useful things about yourself, that can help you to calibrate your compass. 

## What kind/type of person you are
The simplest definition is introversion and extraversion. And you probably know who you are in that context. And even that kind of knowledge can be helpful because introversion-like persons are getting energized buy loneliness and use energy to interact with people, and extraversion-like person live in the opposite currents of energy. 
But there are a lot of other methods and defined types, which you can try: MBTA, DISC, Cliffton Strength, etc. 

Why knowing your personality can be helpful? Because of few reasons:

2. It can focus your attention on your strenghs since each kind and type has strenght in addition to the weaknesses. 
3. It can help you to focus on opportunities that is complimentary to your type and pay less attention to the options that are less likely to fit you. 
4. It can help you to articulate your needs and expectations more clearly so other people can better understand your requests.
